Build an app for a library web store where the user can buy a book if the book is on the wishlist(current clients),
main purpose of the app is to email the user where he will be noticed that he can buy the book with 20 dollars off from the initial price.
For this example use just one newly arrived book.
- user > id.
- clients > firstName, secondName, email.
- book > bookTitle, bookCategory, bookAuthor, bookPrice, bookReducedPrice.
- magazine > magazineTitle.
- wishlist > bookName.
-The email should look like this:
"Hi Steve, we care about your wishes, and we just noticed that the Ciresarii was on your wishlist, we have an amazing offer for you and being a loyal customer you can get this with a reduced price of 40% off today from 
the standard price of 100 dollars."
